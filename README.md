# Flashcards
Quizzes the user on the topic of their choice using reinforcement to speed learning.

Introduction
------------------
Flashcards is a terminal learning tool that allows users to create customized sets of flashcards to be quizzed on.  The program gives feedback on performance and duration of play, encouraging the player to slog through and reach their goals.  For users who struggle with spelling, Flashcards takes some of the confusion out of studying by classifying errors as likely spelling errors and errors due to not knowing the answer to the question being asked.  Several sets of flashcards are pre-loaded (U.S. capitals, French words, metric prefixes, SAT words).  
Future additions will use past performance on a particular question / answer pair to allow more targeted study of pairs the user finds difficult.
